# Introduction 
This is the repository that will contain the Automated Performance Tests for the HRA IRAS project

The Tests are written in JavaScript using the k6 API

The Tests can be run locally on the Dev Box via CLI, using our own Azure DevOps cloud resources, or k6â€™s Grafana Cloud service.  
&nbsp;  

# Pre-requisites
Follow the setup guide [here](https://healthresearchauthority.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/Future-IRAS/Testing/QA%20Setup%20Docs/k6%20Setup%20Guide.docx?d=w5a279156829441af94af27126dd33bc1&csf=1&web=1&e=jjdeRK) to set up k6 on your Dev Box and connect with k6 Cloud

Also review the document along with the [Tooling Standards Document](https://healthresearchauthority.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/Future-IRAS/Testing/RSP%20Test%20Approach/Draft/Automation%20Test%20Tool%20Standards%20Draft%20Content.docx?d=wc9b5951cd936470984f391877ed0bd20&csf=1&web=1&e=PRwea3) (UPDATE THIS)  
to understand the best practices for using k6 and running k6  
&nbsp;  

# Run locally (k6 Open Source)
This method is open source and can be run as many times as you like without using up k6 resources or incurring extra costs.

In VS Code: 
- Open a Terminal
- Navigate to the root folder of the project
- Execute the command `k6 run <relative path of test script>`

For example, if the test script `pocApiScript.js` is stored in the `src/scripts folder`

Then the command will be `k6 run src/scripts/pocApiScript.js`

If successful the relevant test script will run, as per its configuration, and begin logging results to the console. As shown below

Once the test has finished it will print a summary of the results to the console.
